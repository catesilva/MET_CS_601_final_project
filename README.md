# Final Project

## Defining Audience

The first step was to define my audience, in order to create a portfolio that defines my needs. With this in mind, I approached people within my circle to discuss ideas and gain insights. Next, after defining my audience I made an effort to understand them. by asking simple questions, like: what’s the average visiting time? At what pages do visitors usually exit the website? etc…


## Information Architecture

Re-iterative Process


## Responsiveness

I utilized media queries mainly for images, typography and layout structure.  

The responsive layout was build with both CSS Grid & Flexbox, which was great to understand how both work, in particular when to utilize one or the other. I utilized grid for areas that I was looking for a precise content placement, and flex box mainly for the sections that are set to 100vh with vertical centre content, as this technique enables me to allocate space and align items flexibly as they stretch out as far as needed.

These technques helped create a relative minimal media queries.


## Navigation

The main navigation is common and ledas to all pages within the site.
I have added some additional links, such as:

playground.html(page)


## Alt

Images are all responsive and will automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen


## Cross Browser
Compatible with at least the 3 main major browsers, mozilla, safari and google chrome

## Snippets

One of the most interesting elements on the site is the waving hand emoji that will actually wave. The aim of this element's connect with the audience, this is accomplished by the use of animation types that allow the property to be animated with keygframes.


## JavaScript

I utilized javaascript in 3 parts of the site: to install vue, validate the form & implement copy to clipboard function, which was implemented to allow users to easily copy my email


##  JavaScript is required
Added the no script tag


## Extra Credit

Added animation, invested time in the style

##  End
