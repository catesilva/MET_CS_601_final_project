               <p>I'm Cate, product designer turned developer. Thank you for checking out my portfolio. Looks like you’re interested in finding out more about me?</p>
               <p>I’ve always had a strong interest in the visual side of things. As soon as I stepped into the field of the web, I knew I was in the right place. It is creative, collaborative, challenging, and fun. I started by picking up coding on my own, but realized I needed a more structured path to achieve my goals, which led me to enroll in BU's Computer Science program.</p>
               <p  class="mb-4">As a designer, I had the chance to work with many developers, and my interest in computer science only grew over time. I have always been fascinated by what we can build with little or no resources with technology.</p>
