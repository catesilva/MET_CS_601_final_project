                     The company developed and released a minimum viable product (MVP) to test the business model to customers and see its efficiency in the market by early consumers. I was brought in to redesign the app from the ground up and work on the first desktop version of the application, while ensuring that the necessary features were released and the user experience was friendly enough as well as consistent.

                     After I mapped out the IA of the app, I've made a few overall improvements to the existing flows to help the user focus and avoid distraction. Then, I focused on developing the new functions and core features. Currently, they have a simpler interface with the compulsory functions.
